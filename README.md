# Introduction

This README will serve as a "short-and-sweet" summary for my work. If you want a highly detailed and "step-by-step" walkthrough of my design, visit my [wiki](https://github.com/Dishoungh/cpu/wiki). Otherwise, the goal of my project is to start with a simple RISC-V CPU design and then incrementally design more advanced features for the CPU.<br>

**At the current moment, RV32I is now complete and fully verified. The next step is to implement RV64I.**
